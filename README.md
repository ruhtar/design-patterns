## Design Patterns Repository
This repo was made to store some implementations about the more used design patterns on software development.

#### DONE: 
- [x] `Singleton`
  - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- [x] `Factory`
  - A pattern that creates objects without explicitly specifying the class of object to be created, delegating the responsibility of deciding which class to instantiate to a subclass.
- [x] `Mediator`
  - Defines an object that encapsulates how objects interact with each other, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- [x] `Strategy`
  - Allows an algorithm to be selected at runtime from a family of algorithms encapsulated in separate classes, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

#### TODO: 
- [ ] `Facade`
- [ ] `Builder`
- [ ] `Observer`
- [ ] `Adapter`
